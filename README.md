# NgMovies

## Development server

1. Run `ng serve` in one tab and `npm run mock-server` in the other.
2. or run `npm start` which uses concurrently to run both at once.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

1. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
2. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build. For example `ng build -prod --base-href ./` (Make sure rootApi inside environments/*.prod.ts is correct).


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
